PAL signal generation
scanline = 64us = 15625kHz

AHB1 = 36MHz max
AHB2 = 72MHz max

TIM1 on AHB2, rest on AHB1

To get line freq on TIM1, overall divider wants to be 72e6/15.625e3 = 4608

Suppose we wanted 1 count = 100ns (for handy pulse calculation) or 1 coun

Then timer input divider = 4608/640 = 7.2
Can PLL be adjusted to drop main clock?
need 72 * 7/7.2 = 70MHz Nope!, next down is 64MHz gives overall division of 4096 - promising ...
at full clock gives 64 clocks per us

do a divide by 8 to give 8 clocks per us
So counter reload = 512
counter pre-div = 8

Alternatively, leave main clock at 72MHz and use counter pre-div of 9

Pixel clock will be determined by SPI clock.
Clock divisor has to be a power of 2

display area is 51.95us
text safe area is 41.6us however this could maybe be pushed to 48?

characters are going to be 8 pixels wide and its unlikely TV can do more than 30-40 columns
Choose 30, this gives 240 horizontal pixels and a clock rate of
1/(42us * 240) = 5.7MHz

Clock options
pre      72       64       56       48       40
1        36       32       28       24       20   
2        18       16       14       12       10

8        4.5(poss)4        3.5      3
         2.25     2        1.75     1.5

4.5MHz would give 42us x 4.5e6 = 189 pixels or 192 == 24 characters
6MHz would give 42us x 6e6 = 252 pixels      32 chars
5MHz would give 42us x 5e6  = 210 pixels     27 chars

Other options are slow down main clock
PLL      Sysclock    SPI clock
9        72          9

7        56
6        48
5        40

We can get 240 lines by starting at line 47 and ending at line 286
Ideal number of X pixels is therefore 320 (for 4:3)
Text safe line width is 41.6us which would require a clock of 320/41.6u = 7.69
In reality text safe can be stretched, so use 7MHz instead (sysclck = 56MHz)
therefore for 320 px we need 320/7M = 45.7u 
So reduce text offset to 2.5u and set sysclock to 56MHz
With TMR1 prescale at 7 then remaining timings can be the same.
